Test

You can leave an instruction here. It won't be interpreted as questions, but will remain as the heading of the Q&A.
An instruction should be ended with a line made of hyphens.

Preferably, you can separate questions with two newlines so that it leaves a gap.

Each question is formatted like so:
<answer> |:| <question>


If you would like to provide mcqs, you can list the options like so:
<answer> |:| <question>
<optionA>
<optionB>
<optionC>
...

(or)

<answer> |:| <question> |:| <optionA> :: <optionB> :: <optionC> ...

If you would like to ask the user to fill in a blank, you can type a "{}" to do so.

Below are example questions.
